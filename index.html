  <p> Hi everyone my name is Clayton Yan. I'm currently taking a class with Thinkful where I am working on front-end development. I would like to better understand front end work so I that I can do cool things like animation and interactions based on jQuery and other libraries and frameworks. </p>
  <p>Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.</p>

  <h2 class="location-title"> Where I'm from</h2>
  <p> I have moved around a lot. I was born in Florida, then moved to Beijing, China. From there, I moved to Cupertino, CA for middle school. Our family then moved to Bellevue, WA. For college, I moved back to the Bay Area to attend UC Berkeley.</p>
  <p> I now live in Cupertino (again). I currently work at Intuit as an Interaction Designer.</p>
